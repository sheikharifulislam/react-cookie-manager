# CODEOWNERS for react-cookie-manager
# This file tells GitHub who reviews changes to specific parts of the repo.
# Docs: https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# HOW TO USE
# - Replace the example owners below with your GitHub usernames or org teams.
# - Users: @username
# - Teams (in an org): @org/team-name
# - Multiple owners can be space-separated.
# - The last matching pattern takes precedence.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default rule for everything in the repo (uncomment and set owners):
# * @your-org/reviewers

# Examples for this repo's structure (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# /src/ @your-org/web-team
# /src/components/ @your-org/design-system
# /src/utils/cookie-blocking/ @your-org/privacy-team
# /src/utils/tracker-utils.ts @your-org/privacy-team @username
# /playground/ @your-org/sandbox-maintainers
# /playground-next/ @your-org/nextjs-team
# *.md @your-org/docs-team

# Notes:
# - Paths are relative to the repo root.
# - Use more specific rules below less specific ones; the last match wins.
# - CODEOWNERS must be in one of: .github/, docs/, or the repo root.
